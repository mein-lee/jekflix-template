# About Me

Hello! My name is Mein Lee and I was born and raised in Malaysia. I currently pursue a Data Science Bachelor's degree with an emphasis in Applied Math & Modelling and a minor in Demography at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). Following my graduation in Fall 2022, I plan to work in the entertaintment industry -- contributing my skills in data science, analytics, and machine learning! After that, who know's -- maybe I will enroll in a graduate program. The big question is: Is a Master's degree in Data Science worth it? Let me know what you think! 

I know a lot can change in the next few years of my life, but I truly enjoy learning and hope to never stop seeking new learning opportunities.

> ##### You miss 100% of the shots you don't take

This is one of my favorite quotes. I look at the abundance of opportunities available for me in Cal, academia, extracurricular activities... and I told myself that I should at least give them a shot -- even if I feel unqualified, even if I doubt myself, even if everyone else seems much better at it than me.

I transferred into Cal at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and spent my first year studying remotely with a 15-hour timezone difference. Within the same year, I participated in and won a Hackathon, completed a research project, ran a [small online business](https://earnament.wixsite.com/earnament), secured an on-campus job as a Data Peer Consultant, and scored an Amazon internship. I am so glad I took these shots!

My hobbies are binge-watching Netflix, playing tennis, and editing videos. Fun facts about me: I like eating raw garlic, my favorite colors are green and brown, and I am a cat-lover (I watch cat memes all the time). 

To get to know me better, *Binge Read* my blog! You can also add my socials which are all linked at the bottom of each page.

Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
