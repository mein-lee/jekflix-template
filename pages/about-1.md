# About Me

Hello! My name is Mein Lee and I was born and raised in Malaysia. I am currently pursuing a degree in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). I plan to graduate in 2022, enter the workforce for a few years of experience, then enroll in a graduate program in either Machine Learning or Computer Science.

I know a lot can change in the next few years of my life, but I truly enjoy learning and hope to never stop seeking new learning opportunities.

This is one of my favorite quotes. I look at the abundance of opportunities available for me in Cal, academia, extracurricular activities... and I told myself that I should at least give them a shot -- even if I feel unqualified, even if I doubt myself, even if everyone else seems much better at it than me.

I transferred into Cal at the height of the pandemic and spent my first year studying remotely with a 15-hour timezone difference. Within that year, I participated and won in a Hackathon, completed a research project, ran a small online business, and secured an on-campus job as a Data Peer Consultant. I am looking forward towards taking more shots in my future semesters
