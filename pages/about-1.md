# About Me

Hello! My name is Mein Lee and I was born and raised in Malaysia. I am currently pursuing a degree in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). I plan to graduate in 2022, enter the workforce for a few years of experience, then enroll in a graduate program in either Machine Learning or Computer Science.

I know a lot can change in the next few years of my life, but I truly enjoy learning and hope to never stop seeking new learning opportunities.

> ##### You miss 100% of the shots you don't take

This is one of my favorite quotes. I look at the abundance of opportunities available for me in Cal, academia, extracurricular activities... and I told myself that I should at least give them a shot -- even if I feel unqualified, even if I doubt myself, even if everyone else seems much better at it than me.

I transferred into Cal at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and spent my first year studying remotely with a 15-hour timezone difference. Within that year, I participated and won in a Hackathon, completed a research project, ran a [small online business](https://earnament.wixsite.com/earnament), secured an on-campus job as a Data Peer Consultant, and scored an Amazon internship.  I am looking forward towards taking more shots in my future semesters

My hobbies are binge-watching Netflix, playing tennis, and editing videos. Fun facts about me: I like eating raw garlic, my favorite colors are green and brown, and I am a cat-lover (I watch cat memes all the time). 

To get to know me better, *Binge Read* my blog! You can also add my socials which are all linked at the bottom of each page.

Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
