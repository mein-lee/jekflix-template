# About Me

Hello! My name is Mein Lee. I currently pursue a Data Science Bachelor's degree with an emphasis in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). I chose to pursue the data route because I like being sure of things, and making data-driven decisions is my way of doing that. I will be graduating in December 2022 and am open to Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Data Engineering roles. My experiences with data mostly focus on organizing data or making strategic recommendations -- feel free to read the posts to learn more about my experiences!

I know a lot can change in the next few years of my life, but I truly enjoy learning and hope to never stop seeking new learning opportunities.

> ##### You miss 100% of the shots you don't take

This is one of my favorite quotes. I look at the abundance of opportunities available for me in Cal, academia, extracurricular activities... and I told myself that I should at least give them a shot -- even if I feel unqualified, even if I doubt myself, even if everyone else seems to be much better at it than me.

I transferred into Cal at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and spent my first year studying remotely with a 15-hour timezone difference. Within the same year, I participated in and won a Hackathon, completed a research project, ran a [small online business](https://earnament.wixsite.com/earnament), secured an on-campus student consulting job, and scored an Amazon internship. 

Fast forward to 2 years later, I helped a large retail company launch their first personalization strategy using ML, held three student leadership roles, and serve as a lead student consultant for 90+ data research projects. I am so glad I took these shots!

My hobbies are binge-watching Netflix, playing tennis, and editing videos. Fun facts about me: I speak three languages, have had internships in 3 different cities, and have traveled to 4/7 continents. Also, I love cats. 

To get to know me better, *Binge Read* my blog! You can also add my socials which are all linked at the bottom of each page.

Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
