<!-- I noticed that I am accumulating thoughts in my head, and that I tend to keep it to myself. It feels like a hovering cloud that never goes away. Sometimes, the cloud is dark, like the kind of clouds you see before a heavy downpour. The longer it stays, the heavier it feels. But when I open up and start talking about it, it feels like a fresh ray of sunshine. The cloudiness goes away, and it is a clear day in my head again! -->
