<h2 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

This past summer, I had the pleasure of working as an Analytics intern at a large retail company and meeting over 20 interns from different departments. I did not know this going into the internship, but I've gained mentorship, industry experiences, and friendships that I will never forget! I'd like to preface this post by thanking everyone I've met over the short 3 months of Summer '22, and for giving me one of the best summer experiences yet.

In this post, I will step through the end-to-end process of my internship project: generating personalized discount coupons, overcoming obstacles, and learning valueable lessons.

Giving the right discount to the right people is known to make customers spend more with a store. 
As companies shift into the ability to give personal discounts through digital platforms such as phone apps, there is a need to know who should get what. 

In fact, 78% of customers expect personalization, and 71% of customers are more likely to repurchase from companies that personalize experiences for their customers. 

The bulk of my project consisted of working with big data, but I've learned that the most important first step in new strategies is to conduct ample amount of market research. This would help answer the question: "Why is this new strategy necessary?"

By learning from case studies of compaines who have successfully implemented personalization strategies in their phone apps -- HelloFresh, Starbucks, Target, Puma, etc. -- I concluded that their proven success meant that personalization is indeed necessary. I summarized the benefits into four areas, represented by the blue arrows:

This is the reason why Puma, for example, created email optimization marketing campaigns and ultimately acheived 5x Email-Attributed Revenue in 6 Months. 
 
<h2 id="Working in Cross Functional Teams">Working in Cross Functional Teams </h2>
The most valueable skill I learned is to communicate among cross functional teams and convince everyone to be on the same page. 

In order for my project to work, first, I had to learn from the data engineering team about how their discount coupons were serialized and stored in the SQL Server, then discuss which tables within the terabytes of data is of importance to my project. Next, I took a few weeks to conduct market research and created a project proposal to the marketing department. I had to convince the marketing team to invest time and effort into my project because I needed their help to push out discount coupon notifications to email subscribers and app users. Alongside support from my mentors and managers, multiple rounds of meetings, and aligning expectations from both departments... we finally got various teams on board with my personalization project. 

In classes, the start of the project is "import pandas as pd". In the industry, I learned that the start of the project involves crucial soft skills such as communication and collaboration.
