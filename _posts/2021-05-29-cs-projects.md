Build a version control system that mimics Git. Implement the 2048 Game. Generate a 2D tile-based world... Berkeley CS projects really give you something to brag about. 

But not until they've made you lose sleep, stare at the screen for 8 hours straight (then burst into tears),  desperately beg TAs for guidance during Office Hours, scream at your project partner, develop PTSD......

Despite all that, I've learned *so much* from my CS classes at Cal. It definitely pushed me to my limits. Before taking just these two classes (61A&B), I consider myself a pretty bad programmer. Now, I am proud to say that I am a not-so-bad programmer.
