Decade-long burning question (for me, at least). Why is every single TV show's first episode named "Pilot"? Who started this? 

Anyway, welcome to my Pilot episode. My very first post in a personal blog that I finally got around to making. Sometimes I like writing, sometimes I do not. I don't think I'm great at grammar, but I'm honest and genuine in what I write. Sometimes I trail off. 

<em>So</em>, since this blog will be featured on my Resume and whatnot, and since school is such a big part of my life now, I guess I will focus on writing academic articles. But expect other articles like video editing, tennis, travel, random thoughts, "Day in a Life" ....... 

All photos in this blog is owned by me.

Hope you enjoy!
