Decade-long burning question (for me, at least). Why does every TV show begin with a "Pilot" episode? Who started it? 

Anyway, welcome to my Pilot episode. My very first post in a personal blog that I finally got around to writing. In this blog, I will be emphasizing academic articles, but expect other articles relating to video editing, tennis, travel, my random thoughts, "Day in a Life", etc.  

For any questions or inquiries, or if you would like to chat about ML / Cal / Malaysia / FroYo / Tennis / TV Shows (I've basically listed my entire personality), feel free to email me at **meinlee@berkeley.edu**. All my socials are also linked at the bottom of this page. Also, check out **About Me!** 

This Netflix-inspired template was created by [Thiago Rossener](https://rossener.com/). As an avid binge-watcher,  choosing this theme for my personal blog was a no-brainer. 

All photos in this blog are owned by me. Check out my travel account on Instagram [@fervitae](https://www.instagram.com/fervitae/?hl=en).

Hope you enjoy! Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
