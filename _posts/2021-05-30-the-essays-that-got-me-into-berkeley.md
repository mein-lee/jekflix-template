No matter which essay question you pick, no matter which story you choose to tell, make sure to highlight <u>why your experiences make you a suitable candidate*</u>.* Most importantly, <u>be yourself</u>.

### Please describe how you have prepared for your intended major, including your readiness to succeed in your upper-division courses once you enroll at the university.

It all started with a pile of clothes in my closet. Nobody liked them, not even me -- I had either outgrown or grew bored of them. I soon realized I had to get rid of it. As an eight grader who wasn’t drowning in assignments and college applications and whose only source of income was my pocket-money, I started posting pictures of my used clothes on second-hand sales apps. Within an hour, my phone started buzzing. It was my first buyer.

A year later, I grew my account to an international level -- shipping some items overseas. Besides the thrill of making money, I took a greater interest in analyzing the market for preloved products. Based on rookie research and analysis, I developed strategies in offering discounts, providing fantastic customer service, even managing the layout design of my page to different target-markets. I sold everything ranging from children's books to dinner gowns. Feeling confident in interpreting the market’s behavior and trends, I helped my friends set up accounts and provided marketing advice.

Then, I worked part-time for a private university where I helped educational counselors analyze data, conduct surveys and enroll new students. I learned to approach an opportunity only after meticulous planning: brainstorming, hour long meetings, data entry, presentations… but was more intrigued by mathematical logic, algorithms and the usage of data and statistics for problem solving -- almost like it’s magic. 

During my two-year period at Orange Coast College, I committed to completing the required lower division courses for my major and took up two years worth of Computer Science classes to be competitive in this era of data sciences. I found myself thoroughly enjoying the challenge of excelling in my Mathematics classes, even during the summer session. I also utilized a variety of databases on two separate research projects related  to politics and the environment, which created positive impacts on my campus community. As I pursue my goal of a data analyst, I look forward to remain passionate, curious and determined in my courses at UC with the conducive environment, established faculty and available resources.

### Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.

As Vice President of Scholarly Activities of the Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) Honor Society, I chaired the Honors in Action program (HIA) -- a project that addresses a real-world problem in our community. 

Over the summer, I gathered a team of students with similar interests as me in the networks of life to research the role of bees in human lives and the ecosystem. My team and I addressed this by writing a research paper and hosting a bee fair with Orange County Beekeepers Association, my college’s Horticulture Department and Non Toxic Costa Mesa (a residents group opposing the use of non-organic pesticides). 

Given the time and effort required for this project, I avoided burnout occurring by establishing a good communication system among us, starting with a consensus that our well-being should not be compromised by the pressure of this project. I believed that obligations restrict creativity, hence never blamed members who dropped out or lagged behind, rather focused on providing an open space for expressing concerns and exercising empathy. This approach proved effective -- our team worked well together, our event was a huge success. We educated participants ranging from children to adults, served as a catalyst for networking among collaborating parties, and had an overwhelming turnout rate help from more than 30 student volunteers.

 As project leader, I delegated tasks based off each person’s passions and abilities, which proved more efficient than assigning work mindlessly. This strategy put everyone on the same page, helped resolve differences in opinions, minimized possible confusion and provided the much needed moral support to the team, given that most of us had little knowledge about bees.

Passion, however, only took us halfway, as occasionally we need a nudge. Taking cognizance of this, I set myself as the focal point and led by example by being well-disciplined and dedicated to the research, along with providing encouragement verbally or via text messages.

No leader can testify that everything goes according to plan, but with an ability to associate passion with relevant skill sets, a strong motivational spirit and a caring heart, there is nothing teamwork cannot achieve.

### Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?    

If you asked me two years ago: do I consider myself sheltered? Selfish? Ignorant? I would deny it in a heartbeat. I was hardworking, responsible and caring. Sure, I wasn’t perfect, but I had good moral values.

Two years ago, I was welcomed into my arranged homestay in America. My hosts made me feel warm and loved, but also laid down house rules. I can stick to simple rules, I thought. 

I was wrong.

Gradually, I grew tired of being ‘controlled’. I rebelled against the rules to the point of disrespecting my hosts, yet never apologized for it. Meanwhile, I befriended a new group of ‘cool’ people and conformed to bad habits. I made fewer calls and had more arguments with my family who were 16 hours away and worried sick of me. 

I moved out of the homestay and was proud of my independence. My grades were still good, and my friends were still cool. I had everything in check. 

Suddenly, I was stripped of everything. I realized that I traded my genuine friendships for people who were cruel and backstabbing, and was ashamed to seek the shelter of my family or my previous homestay. I had no one to turn to. 

These things happened as a consequence of my self-centeredness; I had to improve myself to regain everything I’ve lost. From then on, I corrected my attitude towards school, relationships, and my personal goals. I seized every possible educational opportunity, be it from school, my peers, or the community. I focused on my studies, chaired positions in student clubs and Honor Societies, earned leadership awards and received scholarships. Everytime I find myself slacking, I reminded myself of the opportunities I’ve wasted

The most significant challenge I faced was realizing that my selfish pursuits put mine and everyone’s well-being at stake. I learnt through these mistakes that I am far from being the best version of myself -- a hard truth that I have been sheltered from my whole life. Thankfully, my revelation happened in time for me to make up for past mistakes and work harder for the future

### What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?

My early experience in volunteering was at a Sunday school run by a Christian community. I gave preschoolers Bible lessons in the form of hymns, stories and crafts while their parents attended the Sunday service. In order to keep the children engaged, I ensured that the classes were fun, interactive, educational and safe. It was an exciting experience as I learned how to guide groups of adorable, hyperactive kids -- even trained myself to be a mentor. On hindsight, although I enjoyed my time with them weekly, I had a nagging feeling that I care for my own learning experience more than theirs.

Then, I started volunteering in my school’s Adapted Kinesiology Program, where students with disabilities and/or chronic illness can perform simple workouts to maximize their physical potential. I assisted and supervised them to avoid possible accidents or injuries -- often throwing in words of encouragement or just conversing with them. Eventually, my aim towards volunteering shifted away from my self-interests. I began to respect the students’ efforts in the workout routines and celebrate every milestone they attained. I returned weekly for the entire semester and witnessed first-had the progression of a student from the disability of holding a conversation and moving his right arm to a healthy lad lifting 20-pound dumbbells and reciting the names of everyone in the room. I developed a newfound respect for the students -- they are strong in ways that many are not, and I wouldn’t want them to lose their strength just because people like me -- people born and blessed with good health -- fail to show them the support they needed.

Helping out the community reminded me of the luxuries that I took for granted; it prompted me to make a difference in others’ lives instead of only focusing on my own. I continued to offer volunteer services in Soup Kitchens for the homeless, book drives, beach cleanup, religious services…… any activity that could make a difference in our society. I am happy to step out of my personal bubble, give back to the community as much as possible and make it a better and more enjoyable place for everyone.
