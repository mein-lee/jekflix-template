# Welcome to my world!

Before you explore this site, <a href="https://meinlee.netlify.app/about/"> learn more about me!</a>

In case it wasn't clear, this site resembles the Netflix interface because I love binge watching TV shows on Netflix _that_ much.

I intend to use this as a website to showcase my past and current projects, and a personal blog to write about topics that interest me. I hope that you would be able to get to know me more after browsing this website!

Happy Binge Read(ing)~
