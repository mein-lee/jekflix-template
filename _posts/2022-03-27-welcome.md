# Welcome to my world!

Before you explore this site, <a href="https://meinlee.netlify.app/about/"> learn more about me!</a>

In case it wasn't clear, this site resembles the Netflix interface because I love binge watching TV shows on Netflix _that_ much.

I intend to use this as a website to showcase my past and current projects, and a personal blog to write about topics ranging from data science to traveling and video editing. If you are a recruiter or are here for professional purposes, welcome! My projects will tell you about my relevant experiences, but everything else -- from the design to the blog topics -- will help you get to know me better.

I also started this site to get into the habit of sharing and expressing my thoughts. I keep to myself often, but sometimes, I have thoughts in my head that I would love to put into words and hear people's opinion on it.

Happy Binge Read(ing)~
