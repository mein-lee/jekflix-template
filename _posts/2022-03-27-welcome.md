# Welcome to my world!

I intend to use this site as a personal website to showcase my past and current projects, and a personal blog where I will write about topics ranging from data science to traveling and video editing. Before you explore this site, <a href="https://meinlee.netlify.app/about/" learn more about me!></a>

Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
